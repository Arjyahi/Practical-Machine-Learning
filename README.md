# Practical Machine Learning

## Introduction

Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit can enable collecting a large amount of data about someoneâ€™s physical activity. These devices are used by the enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. However, even though these enthusiasts regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do, they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of six participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five different ways.
